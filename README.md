# HowMuchDoINeed - A Java Based Android App

## What's it used for

Keeps track of your current grades and calculates your current mark based off your class syllabus and current known grades.

Main function is to calculate of how high a grade is needed for a certain assignment in order to achieve a final grade of some amount (ex. How much do I need on the final worth 30% of my grade if I have a current grade of 70% to get 85%?)
