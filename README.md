## What's it used for

Keeps track of your current grades and calculates your current mark based off your class syllabus and current known grades.

Main function is to calculate of how high a grade is needed for a certain assignment in order to achieve a final grade of some amount (ex. How much do I need on the final worth 30% of my grade if I have a current grade of 70% to get 85%?)


## Miscellaneous Stuff

I'll try to keep updating everyday but my full time job makes it a bit hard. Weekends are good long productive days. 

Update July 16th - Reading and Writing files has been more of a struggle than anticipated. I've been especially busy with applications this week. I will done by tonight so coding this project should be back on schedule in a few days

Update July 23rd - Writing is done for .txt files. Need to work on reading from them into arraylists now.

Update Aug 1st - Things have been busy last weekend. Interviews and stuff (Results out tomorrow wow). Should be back to normal now. CsvReadWrite is complete and functional.

Update Aug 7th - Got into the interview thingy, added a lot of new activities that does stuff, got rid of old activities that did not do stuff. Learned that I had spent all my time formatting spacing when i could've used layout_weight instead.

Thanks for Reading,
Jason
